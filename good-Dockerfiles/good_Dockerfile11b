FROM ubuntu:20.04

# Import the GPG keys, using the apt-key adv command to import a GPG key specified by <GPG_KEY> from the keyserver.ubuntu.com keyserver 
# GPG keys are used to verify the signature of packages, ensuring that they come from a trusted source
RUN apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys <GPG_KEY>

# Enable secure APT
# apt-transport-https: Allows APT to use HTTPS for downloading packages, providing increased security through encrypted communications
# ca-certificates: Installs CA (Certificate Authority) certificates, which are needed to validate HTTPS connections
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates

# Install packages with authenticity verification
# The GPG key is implicitly used by APT when installing packages
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y curl vim --no-install-recommends && \
    apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
